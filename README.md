# skeppio

Visualize ship data from [aisstream](https://aisstream.io/) on a 3D globe.
Earth texture is from [Solar System Scope](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/).

## Running

For now just dev with `go run .` for backend and `npm run dev` for frontend. Make sure to create a `.env` file with `AIS_API_KEY` set to your key.  
I will probably dockerize when it's time to deploy 😊
